## Why "vibes"?

These are context files that capture the "vibes" and implementation journey of the project. They're useful for understanding why things were built the way they were, but aren't essential for running the application.

## For actual documentation, see:

- Main README: `/README.md`
- API docs: `/docs/`
- Agent READMEs: `/agents/task_agents/*/README.md`
- Scripts: `/scripts/README.md`
