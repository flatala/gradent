- Project plans (work, side projects)
- Learning roadmaps or study plans
- Event or trip planning
- Product launches or marketing plans
- Habit-building or routine plans

If you have a goal in mind, share:
- the objective
- deadline or timeframe
- constraints (budget, resources, team)
- preferred level of detail

I can run a planning workflow to turn that into a structured plan with milestones, tasks, owners, and risks. If you’d like, I can start with a quick example, such as “Plan a 6-week Python learning roadmap” or “Plan a product launch in 12 weeks.” What would you like to work on?

2025-11-08 14:41:07,102 - INFO - AGENT OUTPUT: Here’s a compact 3-day Rome plan. If you want a different number of days, tell me and I’ll adjust.

Day 1 — Ancient Rome + Centro Storico
- Morning: Colosseum, then Roman Forum and Palatine Hill (book skip-the-line tickets)
- Lunch: Monti or near the Forum
- Afternoon: Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps; quick wander around Pantheon
- Evening: Dinner in Monti or Trastevere

Day 2 — Vatican City + Trastevere
- Morning: Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel (book in advance)
- Late morning: St. Peter’s Basilica (tower climb if you like)
- Lunch: Prati area or near Vatican
- Afternoon: Castel Sant’Angelo or stroll along the Tiber toward Trastevere
- Evening: Eat in Trastevere; gelato near Piazza Santa Maria

Day 3 — Centro Storico + Borghese option
- Morning: Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva
- Lunch: Campo de’ Fiori area
- Afternoon: Borghese Gallery (reserve ahead) or stroll through Villa Borghese and the gardens
- Evening: Sunset viewpoint at Pincio/Gianicolo Hill, or a relaxed final gelato stroll

Practical tips
- Book in advance: Colosseum and Vatican Museums to skip lines.
- Getting around: Rome is very walkable; use Metro lines A/B if needed (or a 24–48 hour transit pass).
- Food: Try supplì (rice croquettes), carbonara, and pizza al taglio for quick meals; gelato everywhere.
- Safety: Keep an eye on belongings in touristy areas.

Want me to tailor this for a different day count, pace, or interests (food, art, day trips)?

2025-11-08 15:19:41,948 - INFO - AGENT OUTPUT: Here’s a concise, two-day Rome plan designed to group sights geographically, minimize walking, and include time estimates, meals, transport tips, and ticket guidance. Times are approximate and can shift with crowds or weather.

Day 1 — Ancient Rome cluster + Centro Storico
- 08:00–10:30: Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill
  - Tips: Book a timed-entry combo ticket in advance (Colosseum + Forum + Palatine is common). Arrive at opening if possible to beat crowds.
  - Pace: 2.5 hours with short breaks between sites.
- 10:30–11:15: Walk to Monti or a nearby café for a quick coffee
- 11:15–13:00: Walk and explore Monti neighborhood; then head toward Pantheon area
  - Optional quick stop: Capitoline Hill viewpoints if you want a photo with a view of the Forum
- 13:00–14:30: Lunch in Monti or near the Pantheon (try a trattoria or a casual osteria)
- 14:30–15:15: Pantheon
- 15:15–16:15: Trevi Fountain
  - Tip: Early afternoon is typically crowded; if possible, visit Trevi at the end of the Pantheon visit to minimize backtracking.
- 16:15–18:00: Piazza Navona and the surrounding Centro Storico sights (e.g., Santa Maria sopra Minerva, a quick look at the surrounding lanes)
- 18:00–19:30: Aperitivo or gelato break; stroll toward sunset viewpoints or a scenic street (Via dei Coronari, or a short walk toward the Spanish Steps)
- 19:30–21:00: Dinner in Centro Storico (areas around Campo de’ Fiori, Navona, or near the Pantheon)
- Optional evening: Short stroll in Trastevere for atmosphere and a late-night gelato or spritz if you’re not too tired

Day 2 — Vatican City cluster
- 08:00–12:00: Vatican Museums + Sistine Chapel
  - Tips: Book a timed-entry ticket well in advance. The Museums are large; plan for 2–3 hours inside. St. Peter’s area is busiest after the Museums close.
- 12:00–12:45: St. Peter’s Basilica
  - Note: No entry fee, but security checks; dress modestly (shoulders/knees covered). If you want to climb the dome, factor extra time and lines.

- Scheduler Workflow (run_scheduler_workflow)
  - What it does: Schedules events by checking attendee availability, finds the best time, and creates calendar invites (e.g., Google Calendar or Meet links).
  - When to use: Scheduling a meeting or booking calendar time. You provide the meeting name, duration, attendees, etc.

- Parallel tool wrapper (multi_tool_use.parallel)

- Auto-retry: I can keep retrying every few minutes for the next hour and confirm as soon as it succeeds.
- Manual fallback: I can draft the calendar invite text for you to paste into Google Calendar and send.

If you’d like, I’ll retry now with the same details (30 minutes, Google Meet, earliest available). Or tell me your preferred approach. Here’s a quick invite draft you can use right away:

Event: john cena
Date: [earliest available]
Time: [30 minutes]
Location: Google Meet
Attendees: anonimgal31@gmail.com
Description: Quick check-in — agenda can be added here.

Would you like me to retry immediately, or set up automatic retries?

What I need to proceed
- Time zone: Which time zone should I use for “tomorrow at 12:00”? If you’re okay with your calendar’s default time zone, say “use calendar default.”
- Calendar access: Please re-authorize calendar access or confirm you want me to use your primary calendar. I can retry immediately after you confirm.
- Attendees (optional): Should I invite anyone else? If yes, please share their emails.
- Reminder (optional): Would you like a reminder (e.g., 10 minutes before)?

Options
- Retry scheduling now (recommended): I’ll schedule tomorrow at 12:00–13:00 in the chosen time zone, Google Meet, solo by default, with any attendees you provide.
- Manual template (no calendar access required): If you’d rather create it yourself right away, I can give you a ready-to-paste Google Calendar entry (title, date, time, location, description) you can import quickly.

If you’d like, I can also set a small flexibility window around 12:00 (e.g., 11:45–12:45) in case your calendar has conflicts, once access is restored.

How would you like to proceed? Please confirm:

What happened
- The scheduler couldn’t connect to your Google Calendar to check availability or create the event.

What I need from you to proceed
1) Connect/authorize Google Calendar access for me (and confirm which Google account to use), and tell me your timezone (or confirm that I should use your Google Calendar’s default timezone).
2) Confirm the date:
   - By “tomorrow,” do you mean the next calendar day in your local timezone?
3) Confirm the details (these are exactly what I’ll schedule once access is granted):
   - Title: Study Session
   - Start time: tomorrow at 12:00 (local time)
   - Duration: 60 minutes
   - Attendee: franio.latala@gmail.com
   - Location: Google Meet
   - Description: (optional) Topic: Not specified

Optional: would you like me to propose nearby alternatives if 12:00 is unavailable?
- Example alternative slots around 12:00: 11:30–12:30 or 12:30–13:30

If you’d prefer, I can also draft a ready-to-send calendar invite now (with a placeholder Meet link) and you can paste it into your calendar yourself after you grant access.

How would you like to proceed?
- I can wait for calendar access and then schedule automatically.
- Or I can draft the invite now for you to review and send manually.

2025-11-08 18:28:17,995 - INFO - AGENT OUTPUT: I tried to schedule, but I couldn’t access your calendar. The scheduler couldn’t confirm or create the event because calendar access failed, so the request didn’t go through.

What I need to proceed
- Which calendar to use (e.g., primary calendar or provide a calendar_id you want me to use)
- Your time zone (to confirm “tomorrow at 12” correctly)
- Optional: attendee emails, location (e.g., Google Meet), and any additional notes

Two easy options
1) I retry now with your primary calendar (Google Meet as the location by default). If you want this, please confirm:
   - Use primary calendar
   - Time zone to apply
   - Location: Google Meet or another location
2) I provide a manual ready-to-use invite text you can paste into your calendar. Tell me the time zone and whether you want Google Meet, and I’ll generate it immediately.

If you’re flexible on time, I can also propose nearby 60-minute slots (e.g., 11:30–12:30 or 12:00–13:00) tomorrow in your time zone, and you can pick the best one.

Would you like me to retry using your primary calendar now? If yes, please confirm the time zone and preferred location (Google Meet or something else).
