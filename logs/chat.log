- Project plans (work, side projects)
- Learning roadmaps or study plans
- Event or trip planning
- Product launches or marketing plans
- Habit-building or routine plans

If you have a goal in mind, share:
- the objective
- deadline or timeframe
- constraints (budget, resources, team)
- preferred level of detail

I can run a planning workflow to turn that into a structured plan with milestones, tasks, owners, and risks. If you’d like, I can start with a quick example, such as “Plan a 6-week Python learning roadmap” or “Plan a product launch in 12 weeks.” What would you like to work on?

2025-11-08 14:41:07,102 - INFO - AGENT OUTPUT: Here’s a compact 3-day Rome plan. If you want a different number of days, tell me and I’ll adjust.

Day 1 — Ancient Rome + Centro Storico
- Morning: Colosseum, then Roman Forum and Palatine Hill (book skip-the-line tickets)
- Lunch: Monti or near the Forum
- Afternoon: Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps; quick wander around Pantheon
- Evening: Dinner in Monti or Trastevere

Day 2 — Vatican City + Trastevere
- Morning: Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel (book in advance)
- Late morning: St. Peter’s Basilica (tower climb if you like)
- Lunch: Prati area or near Vatican
- Afternoon: Castel Sant’Angelo or stroll along the Tiber toward Trastevere
- Evening: Eat in Trastevere; gelato near Piazza Santa Maria

Day 3 — Centro Storico + Borghese option
- Morning: Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva
- Lunch: Campo de’ Fiori area
- Afternoon: Borghese Gallery (reserve ahead) or stroll through Villa Borghese and the gardens
- Evening: Sunset viewpoint at Pincio/Gianicolo Hill, or a relaxed final gelato stroll

Practical tips
- Book in advance: Colosseum and Vatican Museums to skip lines.
- Getting around: Rome is very walkable; use Metro lines A/B if needed (or a 24–48 hour transit pass).
- Food: Try supplì (rice croquettes), carbonara, and pizza al taglio for quick meals; gelato everywhere.
- Safety: Keep an eye on belongings in touristy areas.

Want me to tailor this for a different day count, pace, or interests (food, art, day trips)?

2025-11-08 15:19:41,948 - INFO - AGENT OUTPUT: Here’s a concise, two-day Rome plan designed to group sights geographically, minimize walking, and include time estimates, meals, transport tips, and ticket guidance. Times are approximate and can shift with crowds or weather.

Day 1 — Ancient Rome cluster + Centro Storico
- 08:00–10:30: Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill
  - Tips: Book a timed-entry combo ticket in advance (Colosseum + Forum + Palatine is common). Arrive at opening if possible to beat crowds.
  - Pace: 2.5 hours with short breaks between sites.
- 10:30–11:15: Walk to Monti or a nearby café for a quick coffee
- 11:15–13:00: Walk and explore Monti neighborhood; then head toward Pantheon area
  - Optional quick stop: Capitoline Hill viewpoints if you want a photo with a view of the Forum
- 13:00–14:30: Lunch in Monti or near the Pantheon (try a trattoria or a casual osteria)
- 14:30–15:15: Pantheon
- 15:15–16:15: Trevi Fountain
  - Tip: Early afternoon is typically crowded; if possible, visit Trevi at the end of the Pantheon visit to minimize backtracking.
- 16:15–18:00: Piazza Navona and the surrounding Centro Storico sights (e.g., Santa Maria sopra Minerva, a quick look at the surrounding lanes)
- 18:00–19:30: Aperitivo or gelato break; stroll toward sunset viewpoints or a scenic street (Via dei Coronari, or a short walk toward the Spanish Steps)
- 19:30–21:00: Dinner in Centro Storico (areas around Campo de’ Fiori, Navona, or near the Pantheon)
- Optional evening: Short stroll in Trastevere for atmosphere and a late-night gelato or spritz if you’re not too tired

Day 2 — Vatican City cluster
- 08:00–12:00: Vatican Museums + Sistine Chapel
  - Tips: Book a timed-entry ticket well in advance. The Museums are large; plan for 2–3 hours inside. St. Peter’s area is busiest after the Museums close.
- 12:00–12:45: St. Peter’s Basilica
  - Note: No entry fee, but security checks; dress modestly (shoulders/knees covered). If you want to climb the dome, factor extra time and lines.
