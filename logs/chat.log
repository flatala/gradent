- Project plans (work, side projects)
- Learning roadmaps or study plans
- Event or trip planning
- Product launches or marketing plans
- Habit-building or routine plans

If you have a goal in mind, share:
- the objective
- deadline or timeframe
- constraints (budget, resources, team)
- preferred level of detail

I can run a planning workflow to turn that into a structured plan with milestones, tasks, owners, and risks. If you’d like, I can start with a quick example, such as “Plan a 6-week Python learning roadmap” or “Plan a product launch in 12 weeks.” What would you like to work on?

2025-11-08 14:41:07,102 - INFO - AGENT OUTPUT: Here’s a compact 3-day Rome plan. If you want a different number of days, tell me and I’ll adjust.

Day 1 — Ancient Rome + Centro Storico
- Morning: Colosseum, then Roman Forum and Palatine Hill (book skip-the-line tickets)
- Lunch: Monti or near the Forum
- Afternoon: Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps; quick wander around Pantheon
- Evening: Dinner in Monti or Trastevere

Day 2 — Vatican City + Trastevere
- Morning: Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel (book in advance)
- Late morning: St. Peter’s Basilica (tower climb if you like)
- Lunch: Prati area or near Vatican
- Afternoon: Castel Sant’Angelo or stroll along the Tiber toward Trastevere
- Evening: Eat in Trastevere; gelato near Piazza Santa Maria

Day 3 — Centro Storico + Borghese option
- Morning: Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva
- Lunch: Campo de’ Fiori area
- Afternoon: Borghese Gallery (reserve ahead) or stroll through Villa Borghese and the gardens
- Evening: Sunset viewpoint at Pincio/Gianicolo Hill, or a relaxed final gelato stroll

Practical tips
- Book in advance: Colosseum and Vatican Museums to skip lines.
- Getting around: Rome is very walkable; use Metro lines A/B if needed (or a 24–48 hour transit pass).
- Food: Try supplì (rice croquettes), carbonara, and pizza al taglio for quick meals; gelato everywhere.
- Safety: Keep an eye on belongings in touristy areas.

Want me to tailor this for a different day count, pace, or interests (food, art, day trips)?
